# GitStats – GitHub Dashboard

This project is developed as part of **Project 2 – API-Based Systems Integration (Option 1: User Dashboard for GitHub Projects)** at ISCTE.

The goal of the project is to develop an application that connects to the **GitHub API** to generate a personalized dashboard for each user involved in a GitHub project.  
The system authenticates with GitHub and retrieves repository information, providing an interactive interface to visualize data and project activity.
